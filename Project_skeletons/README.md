# Project Skeletons

I will have a bunch of directories that contain various skeletons. 

I'll start with simple skeletons just so it is easy to start small apps. Others can bootstrap these skeletons as well so it should hopefully make development a little less painful.

Each project skeleton can be downloaded (without the node modules), and follow the individual skeleton README to set up the project properly.

Don't forget to set up version control (`git init` if you're using git...)
