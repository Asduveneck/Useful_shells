# Node JS Skeleton with eslint and prettier

Simple skeleton so you can bootstrap a simple Node app. Main code should go into `index.js` and the `src` directory.

To set this skeleton up, just change to this directory, and run: `npm install`

Make sure to adjust this README, and adjust the `package.json` as necessary.

## Scripts / Commands

* `npm run lint` runs the linter to check formatting
* `npm run lint-fix` runs an auto-fix, useful for things like import order.

## Notes on file specifics

* `.eslintrc.json` contains the eslint setup.
* `prettier.config.js` contains the prettier setup to help enforce code QC.
* `package.json` contains useful scripts, repo info

Warning: Still a work in progress.
