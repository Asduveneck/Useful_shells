# Useful Configs, shells, etc

The goal of this repo is to simplify my developer experience by having useful scripts I use often, and project skeletons so I can start new projects quickly and easily. Useful shells contains a bunch of random scripts I use often, and skeletons contains empty skeletons to easily start small mini projects.

## Background

 I started this repo when I was struggling with setting up my dev environment for Ubuntu on WSL1. I blindly followed steps online, broke my environment, and had to do so many wipe outs I decided to just automate the process with shell scripts.

Lately, I realize I should practice basic stuff. I shouldn't spend so much time trying to configure the right environment/setup, but rather, focus on coding.
