# Purpose:

I like to automate a lot of processes, and shorten my most frequently used commands when working with git.

I'm writing these shell scripts as I create a dev environment on WSL with Ubuntu. The goal is for me to recreate my dev environment as painlessly as possible.

## Dealing with WSL

I'm looking into better principles and installing helper tools. To that end, I have consulted:

- [Getting Started](https://medium.com/@janelgbrandon/a-guide-for-using-wsl-for-development-d135670313a6)
- [Lukasz's blog](https://cepa.io/2018/02/10/linuxizing-your-windows-pc-part1/#getting-terminal)
- [Nick's blog](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/a-linux-dev-environment-on-windows-with-wsl-docker-tmux-and-vscode)

Nick's blog was very wrong. Horrible.
