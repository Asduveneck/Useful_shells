# Useful Configs, shells, etc

The goal of this repo is to simplify my developer experience, and I hope these help others focus on coding too.

## Contents

- [Misc](https://github.com/Asduveneck/Useful_shells_configs_bootstraps/tree/master/Misc): Currently contains my IDE settings and extensions I use.
- [Project Skeletons](https://github.com/Asduveneck/Useful_shells_configs_bootstraps/tree/master/Project_skeletons): Various skeletons to start new projects
- [Useful Shells](https://github.com/Asduveneck/Useful_shells_configs_bootstraps/tree/master/Useful_shells): Shell scripts I use to configure stuff (my dev env and git for now)

## Background

I started this repo when I was struggling with setting up my dev environment for Ubuntu on WSL1. I blindly followed steps online, broke my environment, and had to do so many resets I decided to just automate the process with shell scripts.

Lately, I realized I shouldn't spend so much time trying to configure the right environment/setup, but rather, focus on coding. I hope these help people launch new apps faster with configuration beyond a simple `npx create-react-app` to ensure quality control and better coding practices.
