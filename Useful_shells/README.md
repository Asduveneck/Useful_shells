# Useful Shells

I like to automate a lot of processes, and shorten my most frequently used commands when working with git.

Make sure to `chmod +400` the shell files to run them.

## Dealing with WSL

I'm writing these shell scripts as I create a dev environment on WSL with Ubuntu. The goal is for me to recreate my dev environment as painlessly as possible. This is also surprisingly useful when setting up EC2 instances as well.

I'm looking into better principles and installing helper tools. To that end, I have consulted a few articles. If you're using WSL 1, I recommend:

- [Getting Started](https://medium.com/@janelgbrandon/a-guide-for-using-wsl-for-development-d135670313a6)

The other articles I read below aren't quite as good or they aren't as useful to install programs.

- [Lukasz's blog](https://cepa.io/2018/02/10/linuxizing-your-windows-pc-part1/#getting-terminal)
- [Nick's blog](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/a-linux-dev-environment-on-windows-with-wsl-docker-tmux-and-vscode)

Nick's blog was wrong (perhaps outdated?), so his whole section on docker, failed. Consult the official docs! Be careful with your aliases too!
